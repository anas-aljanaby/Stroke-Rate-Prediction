Description
This Python project uses machine learning models and techniques to analyze and predict the possibility of stroke based on various health factors.
The notebook preprocesses the data, modifying categories and groupings for more effective analysis. The processed data is then used to generate a variety of visualizations, including distribution plots, bar charts, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots.

How to run the code
Ensure that you have the necessary Python environment and libraries installed. The libraries used in the script include:
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
sklearn
pandas
LightGBM
XGBoost

Place your data files in the same directory as your notebook, or modify the file paths in the load_data() function to match your file locations, and run the notebook.
